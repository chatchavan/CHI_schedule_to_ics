Use it on Shiny server: https://chatchavan.shinyapps.io/CHI-Schedule-to-ICS/

## Developer instruction

* Preprocessed CHI program data in `data` are generated by `R-local/prep_chi_program_data.R`. This file requires JSON exported from the [CHI program](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2021). See the code for the location of the input file.
* For testing, a local-R version is available at `R-local/chi-to-ics.R`
* The template for the description field of the calendar entry could be modified by changing the variable `ical_description_template` in `R/tidy_schedule.R`
